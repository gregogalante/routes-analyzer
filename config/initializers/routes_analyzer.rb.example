# Example configuration for Routes Analyzer
# Copy this file to config/initializers/routes_analyzer.rb in your Rails application

Routes::Analyzer.configure do |config|
  # Redis connection URL
  # You can use environment variables to keep this secure
  config.redis_url = ENV['REDIS_URL'] || 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
  
  # Redis key prefix for storing route usage data
  # This helps avoid conflicts with other Redis data
  config.redis_key_prefix = 'routes_analyzer'
  
  # Timeframe for route usage analysis in days
  # Only routes accessed within this timeframe will be considered "active"
  config.timeframe = 30
