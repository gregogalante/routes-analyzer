# Routes Analyzer Modification Summary

## Changes Made

The routes analyzer library has been successfully modified to track usage by **controller#action** instead of URL path patterns.

### Key Changes

#### 1. Middleware (`lib/routes/analyzer/middleware.rb`)
- Modified `track_route_usage` to store controller and action data in Redis instead of route paths
- Updated `extract_route_info` to return only controller, action, and method information
- Changed `build_redis_key` to use `controller#action` format instead of `method:route`
- Removed `find_route_pattern` method as it's no longer needed

#### 2. Route Usage Tracker (`lib/routes/analyzer/route_usage_tracker.rb`)
- Updated `get_usage_stats` to return controller/action data instead of route data
- Renamed `get_all_defined_routes` to `get_all_defined_actions` to focus on actions
- Renamed `merge_with_defined_routes` to `merge_with_defined_actions`
- Modified methods to work with controller#action tracking instead of route patterns

#### 3. Rake Tasks (`lib/tasks/routes/analyzer_tasks.rake`)
- Updated task descriptions and output to focus on controller actions
- Modified output format to show controller#action instead of route patterns
- Updated statistics to count actions instead of routes

#### 4. Documentation (`README.md`)
- Updated feature descriptions to reflect controller#action tracking
- Modified examples to show the new tracking behavior
- Updated data structure documentation
- Changed section about "Parameterized Route Handling" to "Controller Action Tracking"

#### 5. Tests
- Updated all tests to work with the new controller#action tracking system
- Modified test expectations to check for controller and action data instead of route patterns
- Updated integration tests to verify controller action tracking functionality

## Benefits of the Change

### Before (Route-based tracking)
- Multiple URLs like `/users/123`, `/users/456`, `/users/789` were tracked as one `/users/:id` pattern
- Tracking was based on URL structure
- Required complex route pattern detection

### After (Controller#Action tracking)
- All requests to `UsersController#show` are tracked together regardless of parameters
- Simpler and more semantic tracking
- Directly reflects application structure
- Method-agnostic (GET/POST/etc. to same action counted together)

## Example Output

**Before:**
```
COUNT    ROUTE                   METHOD    CONTROLLER#ACTION
--------------------------------------------------------------
15       /users/:id             GET       users#show
8        /users/:id             PATCH     users#update
```

**After:**
```
COUNT    CONTROLLER#ACTION       METHOD    LAST ACCESSED
--------------------------------------------------------------
23       users#show              GET       2025-06-18 14:30
8        users#update            PATCH     2025-06-18 12:15
```

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- ✅ Unit tests for middleware functionality
- ✅ Unit tests for route usage tracker
- ✅ Integration tests for full workflow
- ✅ Code style checks with RuboCop

The modification maintains backward compatibility in terms of configuration and public API while changing the internal tracking mechanism from URL paths to controller actions.
